This code reads in historic, parcel-level loading data from external files, determines when the load from each parcel arrives at the bay from the sum of 'year built' plus travel time, and establishes a list of decision variables, which, for each zone, is a list of years during the planning horizon for which some percentage of the parcels in that zone can be upgraded.
